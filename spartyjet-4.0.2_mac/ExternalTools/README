This directory consists of a number of external jet tools, together with a few
simple SpartyJet wrappers.  The following files are internal to SpartyJet and
were written by the SpartyJet authors:

ExternalToolsLinkDef.hpp
TransformerTool.hh,cc (wraps FastJet Transformers)
TransformerMonentHandler.hh,cc (provide helper functions to store jet moments)
TopTaggerDipolarityTool.hh,cc
AngularCorrelationTool.hh
Makefile
README (see README for further details)


The following taggers and variables are independent of SpartyJet and were
written by Christopher K. Vermilion.  CMSTopTagger.hh and HEPTopTaggerWraperr.hh
are based on the JHTopTagger code, written by the FastJet authors.  HEPTopTaggerWrapper
wraps HEPTopTagger.hh (see below); WTagger wraps the "wtag" code in External/.

CMSTopTagger.hh
HEPTopTaggerWrapper.hh,cc
BoostVariables.hh
WTagger.hh

HEPTopTagger.hh is courtesy Tilman Plehn, available at http://fastjet.fr/tools.
We have made a very small modification, suggested by Gavin Salam, so that the
ClusterSequence used in filtering stays alive and can be used to access the
top jet's substructure.


The following files constitute Peter Loch's calorimeter simulation, available
from his website (http://atlas.physics.arizona.edu/~loch/index.html).  Some
minor, transparent changes have been made for speed.

DetectorModel.h
DetectorModel.cxx

The Njettiness package in Njettiness/ was written by Jesse Thaler, Ken Van
Tilburg, and Christopher K. Vermilion.

The Qjets package in Qjets/ is taken from jets.physics.harvard.edu/Qjets and
implements the Qjets technique described in arXiv:1201.1914, by Stephen D.
Ellis, Andrew Hornig, David Krohn, Tuhin S. Roy, and Matthew D. Schwartz.
