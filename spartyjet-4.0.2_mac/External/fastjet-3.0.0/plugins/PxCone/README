This directory contains the pxcone code (written by Luis Del Pozo and
Michael H. Seymour) together with a plugin (written by M. Cacciari and
G. Salam) for using it within fastjet.

While permission has been granted for pxcone to be distributed with
fastjet, this is under the condition that it be made clear that pxcone
is _not_ a supported produce.
