This directory consists of external packages that a) SpartyJet depends on
(FastJet, StdHEP) and/or b) have non-trivial organization (W-tagging).

The "W-tagging" package was written by Cui, Han, and Schwartz, and is
available at http://jets.harvard.edu/wtag.  It is all contained in the file

wjet-1.00.tar.gz

The version included here has a small edit (src/wtag.cc:1320) to fix what
seems to be use of a deprecated TMVA function.  Also, the examples have been
removed to save space.
